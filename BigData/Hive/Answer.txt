Part-I: Examine the data

1. Find the total number of tickets for the year.


select vehicle_year , count(distinct(plate_id)) as ticket_no
from parkvio
where vehicle_year < 2018
group by vehicle_year
order by vehicle_year; 

2. Find out the total number of states to which the cars with tickets belong. The count of
states is mandatory here, providing the exact list of states is optional.

select registration_state, count(plate_id) as total_tickets
from parkvio
where (registration_state regexp '[A-Z]{2}') and (length(registration_state) = 2) 
group by registration_state
order by total_tickets;

select registration_state, count(summon_number ) as total_tickets
from parkvio
where (registration_state regexp '[A-Z]{2}') and (length(registration_state) = 2) 
group by registration_state
order by total_tickets;


3. Some parking tickets donâ€™t have addresses on them, which is a cause for concern. Find
out the number of such tickets, which have no addresses. (i.e. tickets where one of the
Street Codes, i.e. "Street Code 1" or "Street Code 2" or "Street Code 3" is empty


select count(plate_id) as Ticket_Without_Add
from parkvio
where ( str_code1 is null) or ( str_code2 is null) or (str_code3 is null) 

Part-II: Aggregation tasks

1. What are the top 5 most frequently occurring violation codes? (Note that
frequency means the number of occurrences over a time period. The list should
be in descending order)


select vio_code , count(vio_code) as counter
from parkvio
group by vio_code
order by counter desc
limit 10;

2. How often does each vehicle body type get a parking ticket? How about the vehicle
make? (List the top 5 for both)

select vehi_btype, vehi_make , count(plate_id) as Count_Violation
from parkvio 
group by vehi_btype, vehi_make
order by Count_Violation desc
limit 5;

select vehi_btype, vehi_make , count(vehi_btype) as Count_Violation
from parkvio 
group by vehi_btype, vehi_make
order by Count_Violation desc
limit 5;
