take decision (statitstical tool)
4.check quality of model/ quality assurrance

Types of data

1.Continuous data - distnace of shopping mall from home
any kind of measurement , speed, temp, density

2.Discrete data - Number of family members.(whole number)


3.Attribute data - Characteristics (could be number or string), rating, yes or no (but when count yes or no it becomes discrete data), catagory, 
like select from option 


counting > Discrete
measuring > continuous

Qualititative - Attribute, qualitative is always attribute

Quantitative - discrete and continuous are part of only quantitative data





Types of scale-: Nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio

Nominal-

Nominal. choice has to be made from different categories. these categories do not have any logical order (languages)


Ordinal-
Ordinal. choice has to be made from different categories. these categories HAVE a logical order (rating or ranking)


interval -  zero does not mean the absence of measurement


ratio - zero means absence of measurement


difference between list and array
-> particular level of slicing is possible in array but not in list.


input to the where command is a logical statement which could be true or false
output of the where command is the index or indices where the condition is found to be true


Data analysis is a process involving the collection, manipulation, and examination of data for getting a deep insight. Data analytics is taking the analyzed data and working on it in a meaningful and useful way to make well-versed business decisions.
